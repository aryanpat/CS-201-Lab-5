# CS-201-Lab-5
In Lab 5, I learned how to take user input and put it into loops for a game like scenario where 2 players must avoid the randomly generated bomb from between numbers 1-100.

# What I Learned
I was able to retetively use User Input in a cohesive loop that allowed me to run a bomb game between two players. I was also able to use a random number method to make a "BOMB" number for every new game. I also used complex loops and classes to take prime numbers from a set of 1-150 and make calculations from said numbers.
